Admin Or Boss can only create and add or remove branch of the bank.
Users can access to their data if they have the permission and password is entered correctly :>

Stack will be used in the application itself to undo and redo any action user entered or needed

if all of the branches customer limit reached maximum, then user should give a request for a new branch to be created.


Name
Password
Debit
Credit

Debit and Credit This is dependent on the procedures the client doing 


Doing all work and scanf's in functions...
Or Making arguments better to make a general code to manipulate whatever you want with the password and data..
So that you don't need to type every single time 


Implementing the stack with callbacks:
1. create a function that returns a value 
2. Argument of this function is the value entered or withdrawed

1. Needed two functions 
1.1 Deposit return positive number  int deposit(int val)
1.2 Withdraw return negative number int withdraw(int val)

2. In normal code, you will need to have arguement for these functions as you will scanf the number you need
